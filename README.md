# Poker JavaScript game with API

## Used tools:

- https://deckofcardsapi.com/
- `button-15` from https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples page

## Limitations

From a practical point of view we used `innerHTML` while building the DOM elements in order to make the code simpler and more understandable. We do not deal with the security limitations of `innerHTML` here because we trust in the content of https://deckofcardsapi.com/.
